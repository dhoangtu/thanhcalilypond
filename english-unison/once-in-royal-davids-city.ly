  Once in roy -- al Da -- vid's cit -- y
  Stood a low -- ly cat -- tle shed,
  Where a moth -- er laid her ba -- by
  In a man -- ger for his bed:
  Ma -- ry was that moth -- er mild _,
  Je -- sus Christ her lit -- tle Child.

verseTwo = \lyricmode {
  \set stanza = #"2."
  He came down to earth from heav -- en,
  Who is God and Lord of all,
  And his shel -- ter was a sta -- ble,
  And his cra -- dle was a stall;
  With the poor, and mean, and low -- ly,
  Lived on earth our Sav -- iour ho -- ly.
}

verseThree = \lyricmode {
  \set stanza = #"3."
  And through all his won -- drous child -- hood
  He would hon -- or and o -- bey,
  Love and watch the low -- ly mai -- den,
  In whose gen -- tle arms He lay:
  Chris -- tian chil -- dren all must be _
  Mild, o -- be -- dient, good as He.
}

verseFour = \lyricmode {
  \set stanza = #"4."
  For He is our child -- hood's pat -- tern;
  Day by day, like us He grew;
  He was lit -- tle, weak and help -- less,
  Tears and smiles like us He knew;
  And He feel -- eth for our sad -- ness,
  And He shar -- eth in our glad -- ness.
